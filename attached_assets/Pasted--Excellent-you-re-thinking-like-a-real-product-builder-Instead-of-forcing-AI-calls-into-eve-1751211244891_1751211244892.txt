**Excellent — you’re thinking like a real product builder!**

Instead of forcing AI calls into every plan, let’s make them **optional add-ons** that users can choose. This way:

✅ Your base templates stay affordable
✅ You unlock **high-margin upsell revenue**
✅ Clients feel in control of costs

# ✅ HOW TO STRUCTURE VOICE AS AN ADD-ON

Here’s how I’d recommend you design it:

---

## 🎯 1. Core Template = Standard Price

→ Keeps pricing attractive
→ Includes all automations except voice calls

**Example (E-commerce Smart Ops):**

* Base price: £349/month
* Setup: £699
* Voice Calls: not included unless added

---

## 🎧 2. Voice Add-On Pricing

Offer it as a simple **toggle or add-on option**:

| Add-On              | Monthly Price | Included Minutes | Setup Fee |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Voice AI Lite       | + £99/mo      | 500 mins         | £199      |
| Voice AI Standard   | + £249/mo     | 1,500 mins       | £499      |
| Voice AI Enterprise | Custom Quote  | 5,000+ mins      | Custom    |

✅ Extra minutes charged e.g. £0.05–£0.10/min

## 🎤 3. How to Pitch It

On your website, show:

> “**Optional Voice AI Add-On:** Let AI make or answer calls for bookings, reminders, follow-ups, and more.”

→ Users feel empowered to decide.
